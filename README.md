Project Title: C# ASP.NET Web API with Entity Framework and Consumer API


Description


This project is a C# ASP.NET Web API application developed using Entity Framework with MSSQL Server as the database. It includes a Consumer API that interacts with the Web API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data. The Web API provides a RESTful interface for managing resources in the system, while the Consumer API integrates with the service for consuming and processing data.



Key Features


1).  C# ASP.NET Web API: A RESTful API developed in ASP.NET Core, enabling flexible communication between the front-end and back-end systems.

2). Entity Framework (EF): Used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interaction, allowing seamless CRUD operations.


3). MSSQL Server: A robust relational database used to store and manage data.


4). Consumer API: A client-side API that communicates with the Web API, sending requests and processing responses.


5). CRUD Functionality: The project supports standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources.
